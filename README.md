# Holomancer
### **THIS IS A WIP RELEASE. IT HAS JANKY ANIMATIONS, MESSY UNOPTIMIZED CODE AND A LOT OF MISSING FEATURES.**
#### This mod will be updated with fixes and new features. It will also most likely be completely rewritten at some point in the future.
Even though it's unfinished, they're still a lot of fun to play.  
We appreciate any and all feedback. Contact us on Discord: **Vegan for the animals#6293** and **Liamono#1206**.

[HenryMod](https://github.com/ArcPh1r3/HenryTutorial) by rob was used as a base. There's probably a bunch of leftover code from Henry - especially in the unity project. A big thanks to rob for the HenryMod, it made developing this project so much easier and streamlined.
