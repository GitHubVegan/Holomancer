# Holomancer
### **THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE. IT HAS JANKY ANIMATIONS, MESSY UNOPTIMIZED CODE AND A LOT OF MISSING FEATURES.**
#### This mod will be updated with fixes and new features. It will also most likely be completely rewritten from scratch before an actual 1.0 release.
Even though she's unfinished, she's still a lot of fun to play.  
We appreciate any and all feedback. Contact us on Discord: **Vegan for the animals#6293** and **Liamono#1206**.

[HenryMod](https://github.com/ArcPh1r3/HenryTutorial) by rob was used as a base. There's probably a bunch of leftover code from Henry - especially in the unity project. A big thanks to rob for the HenryMod, it made developing this project so much easier and streamlined.
